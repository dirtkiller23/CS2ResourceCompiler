# GUI Resource Compiler
A GUI for resourcecompiler with the same options as Hammer for compiling maps, plus more.

# Requirements
- Any Source 2 game and Workshop Tools installed. (If the application cannot find the game, click custom path and select the game's exe.)
 
# Usage

I think it's pretty self explanatory.

1. Open your .vmap file
2. Select the desired options.
3. Click compile.
