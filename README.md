# CS2 Resource Compiler
A GUI for resourcecompiler with the same options as Hammer for compiling maps, plus more.

# Requirements
- CS2 and Workshop Tools installed. (If the application cannot find CS2, click custom path and select cs2.exe)
 
# Usage

I think it's pretty self explanatory.

1. Open your .vmap file
2. Select the desired options.
3. Click compile.
